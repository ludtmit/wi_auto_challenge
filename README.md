1. Get the center of the bounding box
2. Store the data so it can be accessed later
3. Get the distance using the npz file
4. Store the distance and relevant data
5. Use the distance to find the real distance from the light to the car
6. Orientate the graph so that it starts at (0, y) and the light is at the origin (I had a hard time)
7. Display the distance on a graph.


I didn't add data because it should be available.
